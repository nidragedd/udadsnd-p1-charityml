In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RandomForest**\n",
    "    * *Use cases*: \"the random forest algorithm is used in a lot of different fields, like Banking, Stock Market, Medicine and E-Commerce. In Banking it is used for example to detect customers who will use the bank's services more frequently than others and repay their debt in time. In this domain it is also used to detect fraud customers who want to scam the bank. In finance, it is used to determine a stock's behaviour in the future. In the healthcare domain it is used to identify the correct combination of components in medicine and to analyze a patient's medical history to identify diseases. And lastly, in E-commerce random forest is used to determine whether a customer will actually like the product or not.\" ([source](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-random-forest-algorithm-d457d499ffcd) or [here](https://www.newgenapps.com/blog/random-forest-analysis-in-ml-and-when-to-use-it))\n",
    "    * One great advantage is that is an ensemble algorithm \"flexible, easy to use even without hyper-parameter tuning\" ([source](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-random-forest-algorithm-d457d499ffcd)). It often performs well without any tuning and it it hard to build a bad RandomForest classifier. It can handle binary features, categorical features, and numerical features with very little pre-processing. No need to scale data neither.\n",
    "    * Main concern is that they have poor performance when new test data has variable ranges they haven't been trained on ([source](http://blog.citizennet.com/blog/2012/11/10/random-forests-ensembles-and-performance-metrics)). As it is based on trees, it can also overfit if not enough data are provided. Anyway, if there are enough trees in the forest, the classifier won't overfit the model. Moreover, RandomForest can be considered as a black box and is so hard to interpret (so hard to explain and, in the end, convince other people).\n",
    "    * Based on that, it should be ok for us as we have a lot of features but most of them are categorical so all values might have been seen in the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **SVM**\n",
    "    * *Use cases*: face detection on images, text categorization ([source](https://data-flair.training/blogs/applications-of-svm/))\n",
    "    * Pros and cons: SVMs are good even with a lot of features but it seems they are not efficient if the number of features are very huge in number compared to the training samples. If data need to be trained in parallel, they are not good neither ([source](https://www.quora.com/For-what-kind-of-classification-problems-is-SVM-a-bad-approach)). But they can be better than decision tree or logistic regression as explained [here](https://community.alteryx.com/t5/Data-Science-Blog/Why-use-SVM/ba-p/138440).\n",
    "    * We have a lot of features but we have enough training samples (more than 36000 for *'only'* 103 features) so we should not be affected by that. Let's give a try. Moreover, our features have been scaled and we also performed one-hot encoding, SVM performs better with feature scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **GradientBoostingClassifier**\n",
    "    * *Use cases*: \"a great application of GBM is anomaly detection in supervised learning settings where data is often highly unbalanced such as DNA sequences, credit card transactions or cyber security\" ([source](https://medium.com/@aravanshad/gradient-boosting-versus-random-forest-cfa3fa8f0d80))\n",
    "    * RandomForest has already been chosen so why trying another ensemble method ? Because it is a boosting method (meaning \"estimators are built sequentially and one tries to reduce the bias of the combined estimator\") whereas randomforest is an averaging one (i.e \"build several estimators independently and then to average their predictions\") ([source](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#))\n",
    "    * GBTree advantage is its robustness to outliers in output space (via robust loss functions) ([source](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#gradient-boosting)). \"The major reason is in terms of training objective, Boosted Trees(GBM) tries to add new trees that compliments the already built ones. This normally gives you better accuracy with less trees\" ([source](https://www.quora.com/When-would-one-use-Random-Forests-over-Gradient-Boosted-Machines-GBMs)).  \n",
    "    * Main drawbacks are:\n",
    "        * out-of-the box it does not perform as well as RandomForest and we will need to use GridSearch to tune all parameters\n",
    "        * it is hard to parallelize due to the sequential nature of boosting. \"GBDT training generally takes longer because of the fact that trees are built sequentially. However benchmark results have shown GBDT are better learners than Random Forests\" ([source](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-disadvantages-of-using-Gradient-Boosting-over-Random-Forests)).\n",
    "    * For the same reasons as RandomForest, based on our data that are scaled and without any missing value, GBTree should work fine."

By giving a look at the `testing` dataset, when the whole dataset is taken into account, RandomForest algorithm does not generalize so well and GBTree is better. The f-beta score is better for GBTree (0.74 vs. 0.68)  \n",

Let's imagine we have more data than the one which is provided, it would take ages to train but with, in the end, not so much difference with GBTree. Same observation for the prediction time. It takes a while (around 30 times more) to predict with SVM than with GBTree.\n",

    "The chosen model is a *classification* one (it will separate data in 2 classes - in our case: does a given person make more or less than 50K). You could consider it as an 'ensemble of simple decision trees'. The main principle is: instead of building a very complex model that tries to understand and fits very well the data or even finds relationships between columns of the data table (that would obviously lead us to something really complex and hard to understand), it builds a lot of simple decision trees.  \n",
    "Each tree, taken independently is very simple (let's say basic or even naive) but the strength here is that **combining predictions coming from all those basic estimators will provide in the end a stronger model, so a better prediction**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Those trees are built in a sequence in such a way that each time we add a new 'basic tree' to the list of already built ones, this particular new tree will focus on reducing the errors made by the combination of all the others, making then the 'ensemble' more powerful. Due to this sequence, it may take time to train such a model but it remains affordable compared to other algorithms and tests results give pretty good and encouraging metrics so it is a good compromise.\n",

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn.
